<h1>What this website is about:</h1>

This is the first project where I implemented knowledge of
frontend and backend development. The task was to create any e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, a bit of JS, Python and SQL.
My topic of choice was to create a website which can present and sell my own illustrations. All design and even small icons are drawn by myself using <b>Procreate</b> and <b>Photoshop</b>

<br>
Even though this project is not perfect, I uploaded it anyway as this would be a great reminder of where I started.
